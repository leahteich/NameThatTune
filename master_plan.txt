OUR PLAN:
pick a key randomly
play this key with minor chords and randomly generate duration and notes. save this sequence into verse array and save duration because it will be the same for everything except the bridge and rests
fade out of this and play chorus w/o rest
play chorus with different randomly generated sequence but same duration and with major chords of this key
increase volume as chorus comes to end and suddenly rest for 1-3 seconds
fade into verse - exact same as 1st and fade out

verse 			18-30		minor		random generation, saved
	
chorus			18-30		major
	rest			1-3
	
verse				18-30		minor
	
chorus			18-30		major
	
verse				18-30		minor
	rest			1-3
	
bridge 			20-30		notes 2x longer, higher volume than verse, new random generation - harmonic
	fade out
chorus			18-30		major
chorus			18-30		major		2x louder until Â¾ of way through it fades out
	fade out
